A website has 3 Essential Parts

3. JS   : Adds programming

**Note 1**

When the code is very large the JS Code is always put at the end of the File to optimize the performance as otherwise it will have to be loaded in the beginning.

**Note 2**

1. JavaScript is loosely typed Programming Language(No need to define the variable during declaration).
2. JavaScript is Dyanmically Scripted(Whatever the value we pass the type of variable changes).

**Naming Conventions**

1. Name should not be keyword.
2. First char must be a letter or '_' or '$', subsequent characters may be any letter or number.
3. Variables are case sensitive.
